        "The joint OSE+M3 fine-tuned model demonstrates clear improvements in summarization quality, reaching ROUGE-1 ≈ 0.38 and ROUGE-L ≈ 0.32, substantially higher than both the Phase-1 baseline and the M3-only model. This confirms that combining OSE (which teaches simplification and clarity) with M3 (which provides dense biomedical content) leads to summaries that are more fluent, structured, and aligned with expert-written references. The model consistently identifies the central topic and produces coherent scientific statements across DOC, SENT, and CLAIM levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "A qualitative comparison of checkpoints shows that lr = 2e-5 generally produces cleaner and more faithful summaries than lr = 5e-5. For example, the 5e-5 model occasionally shifted to unrelated diseases or gene families, whereas the 2e-5 model remained more on-topic and reduced the most severe hallucinations. In SENT and CLAIM examples, the 2e-5 model preserved the correct clinical context more accurately, although subtle factual inversions (e.g., flipping whether an association exists or not) still occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the joint model performs strongly in linguistic quality and captures the intended meaning better than earlier stages, but it still exhibits biomedical hallucinations, typically small but sometimes clinically significant. This behavior is expected for abstractive models like BART, which generalize aggressively. The model is therefore well-suited for producing readable scientific summaries, but it should not be relied upon for tasks requiring strict factual correctness without human verification."
